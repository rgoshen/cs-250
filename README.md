This repo is made for Module 8 in Software Development Life Cycle.

Interpreting user needs starts with empathy—truly understanding what users value and expect from a solution. Agile frameworks help bridge the gap between what users say they want and what they actually need by emphasizing iterative feedback loops. One of the most powerful tools in Agile is the creation of user stories, which boil down requirements into bite-sized, human-centered narratives. These stories not only guide development tasks but also ensure that the product delivers real value with every sprint. When I develop software, I approach it like building a puzzle where each iteration uncovers a clearer picture. Agile practices such as continuous integration, backlog grooming, and regular retrospectives keep me focused on adaptability and constant improvement. Cobb emphasizes that Agile isn't just about speed—it's about learning and evolving with the customer. That mindset also ties into being a great team member. It’s not just about writing clean code; it’s about collaborating, embracing change, and lifting up the entire team. In Agile, there are no lone wolves—developers, testers, and product owners are all co-creators. So, for me, being a strong team member means staying accountable, communicating clearly, and never losing sight of the end user.
